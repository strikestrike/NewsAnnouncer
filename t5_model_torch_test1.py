            "He began his premiership by forming a five-man war cabinet which included Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, "
            "Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later as Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour's "
            "Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio. In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers "
            "who attended the majority of meetings. The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed, one of the key "
            "appointments being the leading trades unionist Ernest Bevin as Minister of Labour and National Service. In response to "
            "previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created "
            "and took the additional position of Minister of Defence, making him the most powerful wartime Prime Minister in British "
            "history. He drafted outside experts into government to fulfil vital functions, especially on the Home Front. These included "
            "personal friends like Lord Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government's scientific advisor."

            "Halifax proposed that the government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement using the still-neutral "
            "Mussolini as an intermediary. There were several high-level meetings from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French "
            "premier Paul Reynaud. Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious "

            "survive as Prime Minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer "
            "cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over. Churchill believed that the only option was to fight on "
            "and his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British people for a long war "
